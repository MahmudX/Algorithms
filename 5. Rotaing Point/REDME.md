# Find the rotating point

## This problem was asked by Uber

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element in `O(log N)` time. You may assume the array does not contain duplicates.
For example, given `[5, 7, 10, 3, 4]`, return 3.
