# Sorted Squared Array

> Note: Come up with a linear solution, since that is what you would be asked to do in an interview.

You have a sorted array of integers. Write a function that returns a sorted array containing the squares of those integers.

## Example

For array = `[-6, -4, 1, 2, 3, 5]`, the output should be
sortedSquaredArray(array) = `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]`.

The array of squared integers from array is: `[36, 16, 1, 4, 9, 25]`. When sorted, it becomes: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]`.

## Input

1. Execution time limit - 4 seconds (*py3*)

2. Input - array.integer array (A sorted array of integers)

### Guaranteed constraints

- *1 ≤ array.length ≤ 104*

- *-104 ≤ array[i] ≤ 104.*

## Output

array.integer

A sorted array of integers composed of the squared integers from the input array.
